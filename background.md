# Background


Ontology engineering (OE) is in many ways analogous to software
engineering (SE), yet tool support for OE lags behind tools for
SE. Graphical interfaces such as Protege[CITE] provide a rich
interactive Ontology Development Environment (ODE), but there is a
lack of standardized tools for running ontology release
workflows. Indeed there is a lack of broad agreement on standards for
what should be included or excluded in a release, with different
projects making different decisions independently. The Open Biological
Ontologies (OBO) Foundry [CITE] was created to develop such standards.

We present here a tool ROBOT (ROBOT is an OBO Tool) that provides a
standardized yet configurable way of supporting the ontology
development lifecycle.
